# How to edit?
### 1.) First solution (requires a GitHub account):

  Since .ods is binary format then git diff is not good idea and external excel diff tools are not supported then for edit:
  1. Create a new issue.
  2. Type what you want change:
     
       ```mainMenu.camp (en_GB) => Headquador```
     
       ```mainMenu.guild (cs_CZ) => Spolek```
  3. Explain why your version is better.
  4. Wait for approve or comments from community.

### 2.) Second solution (requires a Google account):
  1. Join the Community Discord (https://discord.com/invite/GpcT3N4x3E).
  2. Direct message **ThirdHero**, the admin, and explain what changes you want to make and why. Also, include your Google email address so you can get permission to modify the table.
  3. You will get access for 24 hours to edit the table.
